# Bind

   may be stored anywhere on the host system. They may even be important system files or directories. Non-Docker processes on the Docker 
   host or a Docker container can modify them at any time

# Volume

   Volumes are stored in a part of the host filesystem which is managed by Docker (/var/lib/docker/volumes/ on Linux)

# Tmpfs

   mounts are stored in the host system’s memory only, and are never written to the host system’s filesystem.
